# Tech Stream Viewer
This platform is for all tech minded people looking for particular streams to watch around the technology space. Twitch is very focused on gaming and most people don't realize that there is a Science and Technology category. Because of this, and because of other streaming platforms (YouTube, Facebook, Twiter, LinkedIn, DLive, Instagram etc), this project is to try and filter through all these platforms together to see what is truly available online in the Technology space.

# Contributions

All contributions are welcome as this is Open Source, however it will be done only via forking and creating PRs. This is because this platform will be developed primarily while on the [https://www.twitch.tv/daryl_duck](daryl_duck) Twitch channel as he will be the primary creator of such a platform.
